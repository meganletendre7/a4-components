## Personal Library Tracker

Glitch Link: 

My application works as a method for a user to track what book they are currently reading as well as a running history of books they have previously read.

I modelled A4 after A2, however it is quite different from my A2 as I was unable to get A2 fully working at the time of submittal. I think this one turned out pretty cool! If I had more time, I would work to make my project more similar to A3 so a user could keep a persistent database and track their reading habits past one session. Also, with authentication added, it could even turn into an application that book clubs use to announce what book they are currently reading and keep a log of their previous group reads.

Adding in the new React technology I found to be an interesting experience. Like everything else in this course, I had never utilized this technology before so I found the learning curve a bit difficult but overall very rewarding. I am super interested in UX desing and front-end development so this class has been super good experience for that. However, with an application this simple in functionality, React ended up being a bit more of a hinderance than helpful. The application ended up being a bit clunkier than it would have been if I implemented it without React. I had to mess around with a lot more of the application when it was simple enough to do without React. However, I do see an immense benefit for when the application becomes larger (more classes, functionality, etc), making React definitely the way to go.
